Stainless Steel Plate for Ergodox EZ
====================================

I love everything about my Ergodox EZ except the fact that each half is too light to my liking. I have two, one at home, one at work. My desk at work is a bit slippery and doesn't offer a lot of traction. The friction tends to be better if I clean the rubber feet and the underside of the wings.

Additionally, I wanted the keyboard halves and the wings to move in unison as I never adjust the wings relative to the keyboard, but I do sometimes need to push the keyboard halves away to make space to write at my desk or to eat. 

My solution was to have a pair of stainless steel plates laser-cut on lasergist.com. They have cutouts for the protrusions on the bottom of the keyboard, and each half is just resting on the steel plate. The wings are also just resting, and if the underside is clean, the friction will guarantee they won't move. Under the steel plates, i've put some rubber grip tape.

With this setup, the keyboard halves feel much more heavy and don't move unless I intend to move them. I can also pick up each half along with the wings quite easily to reposition them.

How to buy
----------

* Go to [lasergist.com](http://lasergist.com)
* Upload the design file **steel_base_only.ai**
* Pick the following parameters
** AISI 304 - Shiny
** 3.0mm
** Max width: 200mm
** Max height: 250mm
** Path length: 1050mm (you can see this in the illustrator screenshot below)
** No extras
* Order 2. They are symetrical, so you can just flip the other side. The appearance of the flipped plate will not be as good, but the plates are not visible anyway.
