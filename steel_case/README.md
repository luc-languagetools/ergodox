Stainless Steel CNC Milled case for Ergodox EZ
===============================================

I had previously sought to add some weight to my Ergodox EZ to make it more stable and attach the wings to the keyboard halves (see *steel_base* folder above). This project takes it to the next level.

I designed a case around the Ergodox EZ using CAD files provided by the designer of the keyboard. I then had it CNC-milled out of stainless steel, then polished to a mirror finish by a local machine shop. This was a massively expensive project but it fits my needs perfectly. Each half is now massive and requires a decent amount of force to move around on my desk, even without anti-slip material. The blind holes on the sides are decorative, but also have a functional aspect to them, as I need to pick up each half to resposition them, and also place them on my adjustable standing desk. I imagine myself using this case for a very very long time.

The details. *Please brace yourself before you see the cost, it's insanely expensive.*
* **Cost for Stainless Steel CNC machining and polishing:** $500 USD
* **Weight** (per half): 2kg
* **Design file, left half** (contains sketches): http://a360.co/2cM0Wrw
* **Model only, left half**: http://a360.co/2bNUkGa
* **Model only, right half**: http://a360.co/2bqinwJ

If you'd like to have this case made for you, contact your local machine shop and provide them with the "model only" left and right models. I left 0.5mm of spacing around the keyboard edges, and 0.35mm of spacing around the rubber feet outlines. This was a bit of a gamble as I don't know to what tolerance the Ergodox EZ is built, but ended up working perfectly fine. *I'm not responsible if you spend a lot of money having this made and it ultimately doesn't fit your keyboard for whatever reason. Do your own verifications before commiting any money to this.*
