Stainless Steel CNC Milled case for Ergodox EZ
===============================================

I had previously sought to add some weight to my Ergodox EZ to make it more stable and attach the wings to the keyboard halves (see *steel_base* folder above). This project takes it to the next level.

I designed a case around the Ergodox EZ using CAD files provided by the designer of the keyboard. I then had it CNC-milled out of stainless steel by a local machine shop. This was a massively expensive project but it fits my needs perfectly. I also imagine myself using this case for a very very long time.

The details. (please prepare yourself before you see the cost, it's insanely expensive)
* Cost for Stainless Steel CNC machining and polishing: $500 USD
* Weight (per half): 2kg
* Design file, left half (contains sketches): http://a360.co/2cM0Wrw
* Model only, left half: http://a360.co/2bNUkGa
* Model only, right half: http://a360.co/2bqinwJ

If you'd like to have this case made for you, contact your local machine shop and provide them with the "model only" left and right models. *I'm not responsible if you spend a lot of money having this made and it ultimately doesn't fit your keyboard for whatever reason. Do your own verifications before commiting any money to this.*
