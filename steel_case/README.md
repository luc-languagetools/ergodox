Stainless Steel CNC Milled case for Ergodox EZ
===============================================

I had previously sought to add some weight to my Ergodox EZ to make it more stable and attach the wings to the keyboard halves. This project takes it to the next level.

I designed a case around the Ergodox EZ using CAD files provided by the designer of the keyboard. I then had it CNC-milled out of stainless steel by a local machine shop. This was a massively expensive project but it fits my needs perfectly. I also imagine myself using this case for a very very long time.
